## Minecraft Mods

### [Smooth Boot](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot)
Optimizes Minecraft's threaded performance by reducing executor thread counts and lowering priorities during Minecraft initial loading process.
Now superseded by LazyDFU and modern Minecraft optimizations.

### [Low Fire](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-lowfire)
A client-side mod that reduces the visual obstruction of the fire overlay when the player is on fire.
The mod utilizes OpenGL functions to adjust the fire texture position and opacity.
It's designed to be compatible with all resource packs and provides configurable intensity levels for different gameplay preferences.

### [TexTweaks](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-textweaks)
An graphics enhancement mod that provides control over texture mapping for high-resolution resource packs.
Features include texture scaling (assists texture stitching), enhanced mipmap generation beyond 4x, and customizable LOD bias controls.
Essential for running high-resolution resource packs that do not fully cover every texture in the game.

### [ResolutionControl+](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/Resolution-Control)
A powerful rendering mod that enables custom resolution scaling.
This mod allows users to render the game at higher or lower internal resolutions for performance optimization or visual enhancement.
It also includes features like configurable scaling algorithms, fast high-resolution screenshot support, and dynamic resolution scaling.

## Graphics

### [Simple Fractal Viewer](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/simple-fractal-viewer)
A high-performance fractal visualization application built with modern OpenGL and C++. The renderer uses GPU compute shaders to generate Mandelbrot sets in real-time, featuring interactive zoom and pan controls with arbitrary precision arithmetic for deep zoom capabilities. The project demonstrates advanced graphics programming techniques including shader optimization, color mapping algorithms, and efficient GPU memory management.

### [Penrose Tile Generator](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/penrose-tiling-generator)
A mathematical art generator that uses Matplotlib to create Penrose tilings by recursive subdivision.

## CLI apps

### [Wordle-Rust](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/wordle-rust)
A terminal-based implementation of the popular word puzzle game built with Rust. The application features a clean CLI interface with colored output for guess feedback, dictionary validation, and configurable word lists. It showcases Rust's memory safety features and pattern matching capabilities while providing an engaging gaming experience with statistics tracking and customizable difficulty levels.

### [Vm](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/vm)
A sophisticated text editor inspired by Vim's modal editing paradigm, implemented in modern C++ with a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The editor supports essential Vim motions, text manipulation commands, search functionality, and undo/redo operations. The project emphasizes SOLID design principles, efficient text buffer management, and a flexible command parser that can be extended with new Vim-style commands.

### [Ruse-Interpreter](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/ruse-interpreter)
A full-stack web application featuring a custom Lisp-inspired language interpreter. The backend uses Spring Boot to provide RESTful APIs for code execution, syntax parsing, and result formatting, while the React frontend offers an interactive code editor with syntax highlighting and real-time evaluation. The project demonstrates language design principles, recursive descent parsing, and the integration of functional programming concepts with modern web technologies.
