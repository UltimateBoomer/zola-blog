My name is Steven Cao.
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo specializing in AI, with a passion for building software that makes a real impact.

## Experience

I've had the opportunity to work across various tech stacks in my co-ops:

- **Cross-Platform Mobile Development** at Compass Digital, where I developed cross-platform Flutter apps (Thrive and Boost) serving over **100,000** users
- **Android Platform Development** at Ford, building driver-assist software for next-generation in-vehicle infotainment systems
- **Web Development** at Caribou Contests, managing an online math contest platform for **50,000+** K-12 students worldwide

And, back in high school (Bluevale CI), I was part of the electric car team.
I designed a battery monitoring and telemetry system using a Raspberry Pi, leading our team to win **1st place** at the 2022 EV Challenge for both 12V and 24V classes.

## Technical Skills

I'm proficient in a diverse range of languages including **C/C++**, **Kotlin**, **Dart**, **Java**, **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and **Go**.

I've used various frameworks such as **Flutter**, **Node.js** and **Android SDK**, and I'm able to pick up new technologies very quickly.
