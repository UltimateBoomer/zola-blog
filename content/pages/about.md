## Hello World!

My name is Steven Cao.
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo specializing in AI, with a passion for building software that makes a real impact.

## Experience

I've had the opportunity to work across various tech stacks in my co-ops:

- **Mobile Development** at Compass Digital, where I developed cross-platform Flutter apps (Thrive and Boost) serving over 100,000 users
- **Android Platform Development** at Ford, building driver-assist software for next-generation in-vehicle infotainment systems
- **Web Development** at Caribou Contests, managing an online math contest platform for 50,000+ K-12 students worldwide

## Technical Skills

I'm proficient in a diverse range of languages including **C/C++**, **Kotlin**, **Dart**, **Java**, **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and **Go**.

## Projects & Open Source

One of my proudest achievements is creating Minecraft performance and graphics mods that have been downloaded over **15 million times** on CurseForge.
I've also built various tools including a Vim-like text editor in C++, several CLI applications in Rust and a Lisp-like language interpreter in Java.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of performance optimization, user experience, and system design.
Whether it's about optimizing code, implementing low-level software, or creating platforms many people use, I love solving technical challenges that improve everyday life.
